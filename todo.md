- convert `stateInitStatic` into a function named `stateInit` or collapse it as the return of `init`
    - I can't get this to work, TS won't correctly infer the state type
- remove `isStrictInstance`
- add testIds to an element's definition
- allow arbitrary static data in the element definition
- unify event types with the `typed-event-listener` package
- expose host classes in the `render` callback.
